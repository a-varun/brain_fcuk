==========
This Contains the Brainf**k interpreter and Text-To-Brainf**k compiler program.

I used a DLL which I used as the memory element while compilation.
Also, I check for syntax error, which is mainly over loops.
I also check for memory leaks while running the program.

Also, in the text to brainf**k translater, I first check the characters 
present in the string and I dynnamically initialize the memory just for the
characters required.
